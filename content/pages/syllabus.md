Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 4 sessions / week, 3 hours / session

Course Summary
--------------

This course begins with a comparative review of conventional and advanced multiple attribute decision making (MADM) models in engineering practice. Next, a new application of particular MADM models in reliable material selection of sensitive structural components as well as a multi-criteria Taguchi optimization method is discussed. Other specific topics include dealing with uncertainties in material properties, incommensurability in decision-makers opinions for the same design, objective ways of weighting performance indices, rank stability analysis, compensations and non-compensations.

This IAP course is open to all graduate students and researchers for registration or audition. Those who register, however, will be recognized for two credits after passing a take-home exam and conducting a project at the end of the course. The course readings are selected to strengthen students' awareness of both the theory and practice of the related areas.
